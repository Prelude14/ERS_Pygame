# ERS_Pygame

This is the first level of my ERS in pygame. It's also my first game ever, so its a little silly and very basic.
The current version as of Feb 14 2019 is essenitally just a room with a clickable door.
You shouldn't need anything special packages or anything to run it as of right now.
Just Pygame of course!

-Cheers
